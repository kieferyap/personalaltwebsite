- Allows users to store information about the books used, their respective flashcards, and the activities within them, into the system.
- Allows users to enter their own custom activities.
- Allows users to digitally manage their lesson plans using the activities that were stored into the database.
- This keeps everything organized and in one place.

### Class Schedule Management:

- Allows users to manage year levels, assigning books and storing notes about each section.
- Users can store their day-to-day class schedule in the system, and assign lesson plans to them. This information is viewable in the dashboard and printable for use.
- ALTs usually get their schedules from their schools in paper form, which results in the ALT having to maintain a ton of sheets. Having it all stored digitally prevents loss of information due to schedule misplacement.
- With different sections from different schools, ALTs would need to keep track of which class is in which lesson, and having it all stored and organized digitally lifts the burden of remembering everything from the ALT.

### School Year Information Management:

- Allows users to create a new school year by specifying its start and end dates
- Allows users to store school information, digitally manage their yearly schedule, and save them all in the database.
- Allows users to download a digital copy of their yearly schedule and add it to their calendars (e.g.: Google Calendar)
- This prevents the issue of going to the incorrect school.

## Overview

### Motivation:

After a few months of being in the education industry, I wanted to have a centralized system to manage all my ALT-related information. I noticed that a lot of things would become way easier and much more convenient if there was a centralized system managing everything, and automating things that can be automated. It's just a project to scratch my back, but I hope it scratches yours too.
