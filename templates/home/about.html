					<li>Allows users to enter their own custom activities.</li>
					<li>Allows users <b>to digitally manage their lesson plans</b> using the activities that were stored into the database.</li>

					<li>Allows users to manage year levels, assigning books and storing notes about each section.</li>
					<li>Users can store their day-to-day class schedule in the system, and assign lesson plans to them. This information is viewable in the dashboard and printable for use.</li>
					<li>ALTs usually get their schedules from their schools in paper form, which results in the ALT having to maintain a ton of sheets. <b>Having it all stored digitally prevents loss of information due to schedule misplacement.</b></li>
					<li>With different sections from different schools, ALTs would need to keep track of which class is in which lesson, and <b>having it all stored and organized digitally lifts the burden of remembering everything from the ALT.</b></li>

				<li><h4>Automated PDF Timesheet Generation:</h4></li>
				<ul>
					<li>By specifying the schools and the start and end months, users can auto-generate timesheets pre-filled with schedule information pulled from the database.</li>
					<li>The generated PDF has asterisks denoting areas that need to be stamped. It also has an asterisk at the bottom of the page where the name of the person in charge needs to be written.</li>
					<li>An automatically pre-filled timesheet with asterisks denoting required fields <b>lessens mistakes, and under normal circumstances, all the ALT has to do is to have it stamped.</b></li>

					<li>Allows users to easily manage and enter their reimbursement information in the official website.</li>

			I'm Kiefer, and I used to be a professional software engineer, dealing with web and mobile technologies before becoming an ALT. I've switched between front-end (client-side/UI/UX/etc.) and back-end (server-side/background logic/etc.) in various projects during my software engineering career. 
			</p>
			<p>
			After becoming an ALT, I noticed that a lot of things would become way easier and much more convenient if there was a centralized system managing everything, and automating things that can be automated.
			</p>
			<p>
			The system is currently tailored for my personal use, so if there are any specific modifications that are desired (e.g.: Schedulers can manage the schedule of the ALTs, ALTs can only view their schedule and only have access to certain parts of the site, etc.), please feel free to contact me.
			</p>
			<p>
			Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope that this system is helpful!
